<p>This is the blah blah blah of the post, I just needed a second one.  I don't know what to write.  </p>
<p>This will just be some text that I can run my code on. Eventually there will be a real post here, and the content will be for the content not just to have a second post.</p>
<p>I need some really long content that looks like it will be right.  Without somethings longer, I cannot get a feel of how the page will really look.  </p>
<h2 id="five-years-have-past-five-summers-with-the-length">Five years have past; five summers, with the length<a class="headerlink" href="#five-years-have-past-five-summers-with-the-length" title="Permanent link">§</a></h2>
<p>Of five long winters! and again I hear These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs With a soft inland murmur.—Once againDo I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, That on a wild secluded scene impressThoughts of more deep seclusion; and connectThe landscape with the quiet of the sky.The day is come when I again reposeHere, under this dark sycamore, and viewThese plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves‘Mid groves and copses. Once again I seeThese hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little linesOf sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,Green to the very door; and wreaths of smokeSent up, in silence, from among the trees!With some uncertain notice, as might seemOf vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,Or of some Hermit’s cave, where by his fireThe Hermit sits alone.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through a long absence, have not been to me<br/>
As is a landscape to a blind man’s eye:<br/>
But oft, in lonely rooms, and ‘mid the din<br/>
Of towns and cities, I have owed to them<br/>
In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,<br/>
Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;<br/>
And passing even into my purer mind,<br/>
With tranquil restoration:—feelings too<br/>
Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,<br/>
As have no slight or trivial influence<br/>
On that best portion of a good man’s life,<br/>
His little, nameless, unremembered, acts<br/>
Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust,<br/>
To them I may have owed another gift,<br/>
Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,<br/>
In which the burthen of the mystery,<br/>
In which the heavy and the weary weight<br/>
Of all this unintelligible world,<br/>
Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood,<br/>
In which the affections gently lead us on,—<br/>
Until, the breath of this corporeal frame<br/>
And even the motion of our human blood<br/>
Almost suspended, we are laid asleep<br/>
In body, and become a living soul:<br/>
While with an eye made quiet by the power<br/>
Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,<br/>
We see into the life of things.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="if-this">If this<a class="headerlink" href="#if-this" title="Permanent link">§</a></h2>
<p>Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft—<br/>
In darkness and amid the many shapes<br/>
Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir<br/>
Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,<br/>
Have hung upon the beatings of my heart—<br/>
How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee,<br/>
O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro’ the woods,<br/>
How often has my spirit turned to thee!<br/>
And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,<br/>
With many recognitions dim and faint,<br/>
And somewhat of a sad perplexity,<br/>
The picture of the mind revives again:<br/>
While here I stand, not only with the sense<br/>
Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts<br/>
That in this moment there is life and food<br/>
For future years. And so I dare to hope,<br/>
Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first<br/>
I came among these hills; when like a roe<br/>
I bounded o’er the mountains, by the sides<br/>
Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,<br/>
Wherever nature led: more like a man<br/>
Flying from something that he dreads, than one<br/>
Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then<br/>
(The coarser pleasures of my boyish days,<br/>
And their glad animal movements all gone by)<br/>
To me was all in all.—I cannot paint<br/>
What then I was. The sounding cataract<br/>
Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,<br/>
The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,<br/>
Their colours and their forms, were then to me<br/>
An appetite; a feeling and a love,<br/>
That had no need of a remoter charm,<br/>
By thought supplied, nor any interest<br/>
Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past,<br/>
And all its aching joys are now no more,<br/>
And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this<br/>
Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur, other gifts<br/>
Have followed; for such loss, I would believe,<br/>
Abundant recompence. For I have learned<br/>
To look on nature, not as in the hour<br/>
Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes<br/>
The still, sad music of humanity,<br/>
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power<br/>
To chasten and subdue. And I have felt<br/>
A presence that disturbs me with the joy<br/>
Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime<br/>
Of something far more deeply interfused,<br/>
Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,<br/>
And the round ocean and the living air,<br/>
And the blue sky, and in the mind of man;<br/>
A motion and a spirit, that impels<br/>
All thinking things, all objects of all thought,<br/>
And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still<br/>
A lover of the meadows and the woods,<br/>
And mountains; and of all that we behold<br/>
From this green earth; of all the mighty world<br/>
Of eye, and ear,—both what they half create,<br/>
And what perceive; well pleased to recognise<br/>
In nature and the language of the sense,<br/>
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,<br/>
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul<br/>
Of all my moral being.</p>
