                    An electrical engineer turned computer scientist (after coming across extremely interesting techniques used during graduate research).

                <p>
                    Loves high-level languages &amp; algorithms that allow for development at an information / data level where most of the implementation is abstracted from the processing (enter python, stage right, playing the part of executable psuedo-code). With a good dose of client side web stack experience for interesting presentation layers and user interaction, long-term interests include python, machine learning, data-mining, data visualization and natural language processing.
